```bash

npm install -g gitpick

# Download the Firebase quickstart
gitpick openfort-xyz/openfort-react examples/quickstarts/firebase

# Download the Headless quickstart
gitpick openfort-xyz/openfort-react examples/quickstarts/headless
```

## Available Quickstarts

- **headless** - Headless implementation quickstart

Each quickstart is a complete, minimal example that you can use as a starting point for your project.

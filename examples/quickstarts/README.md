# Quickstarts

This directory contains quickstart examples for getting started with Openfort React.

## Download a specific quickstart

Instead of cloning the entire repository, you can download just the quickstart you need using [gitpick](https://github.com/JamieMason/gitpick):

```bash
# Download the Firebase quickstart
npx gitpick openfort-xyz/openfort-react/tree/main/examples/quickstarts/firebase

# Download the Headless quickstart
npx gitpick openfort-xyz/openfort-react/tree/main/examples/quickstarts/headless
```

## Available Quickstarts

- **firebase** - Firebase integration quickstart
- **headless** - Headless implementation quickstart

Each quickstart is a complete, minimal example that you can use as a starting point for your project.
